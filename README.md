## Setup

To set up the project you need `npm` and `node installed`. To run the project locally:

```
npm i -g ionic
npm i
ionic serve
```

## Connecting to the node/smart-contract

Replace the IP in `dapp.service.ts` to connect to the node. The file is located in `src/services/dapp/dapp.service.ts`.

Replace `http://130.82.239.102:8080/api/` with your IP.
